# API-Load-Testing-Client-Mocha-Chai
This code comes from the larger client I wrote while serving as a Product &amp; Engineering Intern at Rightsline, a digital rights management software. The project included writing a client that the engineering team could then use to load test an updated version of our API. I used the Mocha test framework and Chai assertion library to complete this project.
